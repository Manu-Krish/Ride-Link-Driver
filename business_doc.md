## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Opportunity

In Kochi, Kerala, there are thousands of commercial taxi drivers and vehicle owners operating in a fragmented, informal market. Drivers struggle to find available taxis to rent, while vehicle owners face challenges in finding verified, trustworthy drivers. This creates inefficiency, lost income opportunities, and operational risks for both parties.

### Our Solution

A mobile application that connects verified drivers with vehicle owners through a secure, legally-protected digital marketplace. The platform provides comprehensive verification, digital rental agreements, and management tools to transform the informal taxi rental market into a trusted, efficient ecosystem.

### Market Validation

- Taxi rental is already a common practice in Kerala
- Current process is entirely offline, relying on personal networks and word-of-mouth
- No dominant digital platform exists in this space
- Similar models (Yellow Plate, The TAXI Partner) are operating successfully in other Indian cities

### Business Model

- **Phase 1:** Zero platform fees to build user base and establish trust
- **Phase 2:** Revenue through sponsored listings, in-app advertising, and premium features
- **Phase 3:** Small transaction fees or subscription model for power users

### Regulatory Status

The business is legal in Kerala but requires:

- Motor Vehicle Aggregator License (₹5 lakh + security deposit)
- Company registration (Private Limited/LLP)
- Compliance with Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines 2025
- Full operational compliance (24/7 control room, insurance, GPS tracking, etc.)

### Investment Required

Minimum ₹20-25 lakhs for:

- Legal setup and licensing: ₹10-15 lakhs
- Technology development: ₹5-8 lakhs
- Operations and working capital: ₹5-7 lakhs
